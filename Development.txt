Dec. 4:
Blake: changed address lookup to use the city bounds, so you don't have to append "regina, sk" to the address or risk getting an address from timbuktu
fixed a few ui bugs with the marker that displays when you search an address

Andrew: moved data to it's own folder and wrapped up the python code into a function.
